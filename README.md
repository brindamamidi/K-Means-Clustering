# KMeans Clustering on Country Data

## Description
This project performs KMeans clustering on a dataset of various country indicators. The primary goal is to identify patterns and group countries into clusters based on their socio-economic features. KMeans clustering is a form of unsupervised learning which is useful in identifying structure and patterns within the data.  

 
## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
## Skills Demonstrated
### 1. Load and Preprocess Data
### 2. Feature Selection
  - Create a correlation map of features and explore relationships between them
  - Identify and generate scatter plots of the features with strongest correlations (e.g. Child mortality and GDPP)  
### 3. Data Scaling
  - Determine the distrubtion of the data and scale the data
### 4. Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters
  - Plot the elbow curve and the silhouette score method
  - Determine the best k value
### 5. Visualisation of Clusters
  - Fit a KMeans model with the selected number of clusters
  - Label the groups of countries based on the clusters
  - Add the predicted cluster label column to the original dataframe
  - Determine the silhouette score
  - Visualise the clusters with selected scatter plots
### 6. Conclusion
  - Analyze the clusters including the strengths and limitations of the model
